### Packages for glm's and associated methods
The current vignette is a quick analysis of all CRAN packages that have "glm" in their name. The crude assumption we make here is that a package with "glm" in its name does something related to generalized linear models.

### CRAN package directives and author collaboration networks

Let's attach **cranly**
```{r}
library("cranly")
```
and use the package directives and author collaboration networks from CRAN's state on `r format(attr(package_network, "timestamp"), usetz = TRUE)`
```{r}
data("package_network", package = "cranly")
data("author_newtwork", package = "cranly")
```

### Packages for generalized linear models

The packages that have "glm" in their name are
```{r}
(glm_packages <- package_with(package_network, name = "glm"))
```

The sub-network for `glm_packages` can be visualized using
```{r}
plot(package_network, package = glm_packages)
```
In order to focus on the sub-network with edges *only* between the packages in `glm_packages`, we do
```{r}
glm_package_only_network <- subset(package_network, package = glm_packages, only = TRUE)
plot(glm_package_only_network, package = glm_packages)
```

The top-20 packages in terms of various statistics of the directives sub-network for generalized linear models according to the number they are imported by other packages
```{r}
glm_package_network <- subset(package_network, package = glm_packages)
glm_package_summaries <- summary(glm_package_network)
plot(glm_package_summaries, according_to = "n_imported_by")
```

The top-20 in the collaboration sub-network for generalized linear models according to the number of collaborators is
```{r}
glm_author_network <- subset(author_network, package = glm_packages)
glm_author_summaries <- summary(glm_author_network)
plot(glm_author_summaries, according_to = "n_collaborators")
```
